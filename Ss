Hi Team,

We have been facing an issue with the image creation process.

We have around seven images, most of which are being promoted to production. As per the suggestion, we are removing or updating the UID of users during the image creation process.

However, we are unable to create one of our images because updating the UID is throwing an error: "PID is running; we can't update UID."

We have been using the following Ansible Galaxy role during the image creation process as suggested in the GCP Confluence page: [GCP Lockdown & Compliance](https://alm-confluence).



The problem is that while using this Ansible Galaxy role, the process gets stuck for a long time without giving any result. Please find the attachment for more details.

Let me know if you need any more adjustments.
